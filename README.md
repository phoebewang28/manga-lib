## description
Was feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with the available filtering functions on the manga website I use. It was too difficult to try and find manga I had read previously. Decided to try and scrape the data from my page to a Google Sheet so I could filter by date/rating/genre and see all 200+ manga on one screen instead of having to scroll through 20 pages :D
